<h1 id="titleheader">About <abbr title="Norwegian-American Digital Catalog">Nordic</abbr></h1>
<p>This website is named Nordic (<strong>Nor</strong>wegian-American <strong>Di</strong>gital <strong>C</strong>atalog) and it is a result of many hours of work spent inventorying archival materials down to the folder level. Much like a library catalog, this catalog will only tell users what materials are held at the archives and where they are located. The majority of these letters, reports, and papers are not digitized and only a small amount of photographs are available to search and browse under “Digital Images.” Future plans include adding more digital content and images and also to explore the inclusion of other Scandinavian-American materials from additional repositories and locations. </p>


<h2>About “Journeys to America”</h2>
<p>In June 2011, Luther College in partnership with Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum received a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission to create an aggregate, online catalog of materials from both repositories. The project was named “Journeys to America” to emphasize the documentation of the immigration story.
